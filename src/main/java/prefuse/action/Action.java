/**
 * <p>Actions are building blocks that perform any number of operations on a
 * Visualization, typically processing VisualItems to set various visual
 * attributes. This class is a base implementation for Action instances.
 * Developers can subclass this class and implement the <code>run</code> method
 * to create their own custom Actions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>After instantiating an Action, you should register it with a particular
 * Visualization before running it. Use the
 * {@link prefuse.Visualization#putAction(String, Action)} to do this. This
 * will ensure that the Action is configured to use that Visualization. If
 * an Action is part of an {@link ActionList} or {@link ActionSwitch}, it is
 * sufficient to only register that CompositeAction with the Visualization
 * -- all contained Action instances will be configured appropriately. You
 * can then run the Actions using the {@link prefuse.Visualization#run(String)}
 * method and other similar methods of the {@link prefuse.Visualization} class.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>As a subclass of Activity, Actions can be of two kinds. 
 * <i>Run-once</i> action lists have
 * a duration value of zero, and simply run once when scheduled. Actions
 * with a duration greater than zero can be executed multiple times, waiting
 * a specified step time between each execution until the activity has run for
 * its full duration. A duration of Activity.INFINITE will result in a
 * continually re-running Action.</p>
